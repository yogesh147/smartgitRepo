Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
It is a sequence of object that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce desired results
It is not a Data Structure instead it takes I/P from collections, arrays and I/O channels.
It does not change Data Structure, they only provide results based on pipelined methods (with terminal methods)

WHY IT NEED ?

First use is, Functional programming by using lambdas expression.
Second is, Code reduced by using streams method chaining process.    
Third is , Perform bulk operations (filter -> map -> forEach ).
